# Tasks: API Resilience Completion

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/002-api-resilience-completion/`

**Prerequisites**: `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`,
`contracts/api-contract.md`, `quickstart.md`

**Tests**: Required for every behavior change. Focused tests must fail before the related
implementation is added.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Different files and no incomplete dependency prevent parallel work.
- **[US1]**–**[US4]** map to the prioritized stories in `spec.md`.

## Phase 1: Setup and Baseline

- [x] T001 Record the 135-test/597-assertion baseline, branch, prior commit, and untracked-file ownership in `specs/002-api-resilience-completion/tasks.md`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Decisions

- [x] T002 Confirm media cleanup identity, deterministic notification UUID inputs, database-first channel order, process barrier contract, and listing validation limits against `specs/002-api-resilience-completion/data-model.md`

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Failure-Safe Product Images (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Catalogue mutations never reference prematurely deleted files and failed cleanup remains retryable.

**Independent Test**: Force persistence and delete failures, then prove compensation and scheduled cleanup.

### Tests for User Story 1

- [x] T003 [P] [US1] Add create/update/delete compensation and pending-cleanup tests in `tests/Feature/Product/ProductImageSafetyTest.php`
- [x] T004 [P] [US1] Add cleanup command and schedule discovery tests in `tests/Feature/Maintenance/ProductImageCleanupTest.php`

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T005 [US1] Add the additive pending-file-deletion migration in `database/migrations/2026_07_22_010000_create_pending_file_deletions_table.php`
- [x] T006 [US1] Add the cleanup model in `app/Models/PendingFileDeletion.php`
- [x] T007 [US1] Implement compensating create/update/delete and idempotent cleanup in `app/Services/Products/ProductImageService.php`
- [x] T008 [US1] Add bounded scheduled cleanup in `app/Console/Commands/CleanupProductImages.php` and `routes/console.php`
- [x] T009 [US1] Route product mutations through the image service in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProductController.php`
- [x] T010 [US1] Run focused product image and maintenance tests and reconcile documentation in `docs/reliability.md`

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Race-Safe Notification Delivery (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: One recipient/event produces one durable in-app notification and at most one SMS attempt.

**Independent Test**: Retry all listeners and race one logical delivery against a shared database.

### Tests for User Story 2

- [x] T011 [P] [US2] Add deterministic ID and duplicate-key behavior tests in `tests/Unit/Services/Notifications/NotificationDeduplicatorTest.php`
- [x] T012 [P] [US2] Add listener retry, channel-order, SMS-count, and subscription-failure tests in `tests/Feature/Notification/NotificationDeduplicationTest.php`

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T013 [US2] Implement deterministic database-backed delivery in `app/Services/Notifications/NotificationDeduplicator.php`
- [x] T014 [US2] Put the database channel before SMS in `app/Notifications/BackInStockNotification.php` and `app/Notifications/OrderStatusChangedNotification.php`
- [x] T015 [US2] Replace listener check-then-send/delete-first flows in `app/Listeners/SendNewProductNotifications.php`, `app/Listeners/SendBackInStockNotifications.php`, and `app/Listeners/SendOrderStatusNotification.php`
- [x] T016 [US2] Update existing notification regression tests for injected listeners in `tests/Feature/Notification/` and `tests/Feature/Order/OrderStatusTest.php`
- [x] T017 [US2] Run focused notification and order-status tests and update the deduplication boundary in `README.md`

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Production-Database Concurrency Proof (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Independent processes prove order locking and notification uniqueness on both production databases.

**Independent Test**: Two barrier-synchronized child processes race last-unit stock,
competing multi-unit stock, and one logical notification.

### Tests and Harness for User Story 3

- [x] T018 [US3] Add the strict child-process worker protocol in `tests/Support/concurrent_worker.php`
- [x] T019 [US3] Add order and notification overlap scenarios with explicit SQLite/process skips in `tests/Feature/Concurrency/ProductionDatabaseConcurrencyTest.php`
- [x] T020 [US3] Extend production database jobs for MySQL 8 and PostgreSQL 16 in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- [x] T021 [US3] Run the concurrency scenarios in disposable MySQL and PostgreSQL containers and record outcomes in `specs/002-api-resilience-completion/tasks.md`

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Predictable Listing Validation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Invalid product/order collection inputs receive field-specific 422 responses.

**Independent Test**: Exercise every invalid field and confirm valid listing behavior remains unchanged.

### Tests for User Story 4

- [x] T022 [P] [US4] Add invalid product filter, range, boolean, sort, and pagination tests in `tests/Feature/Product/ProductListingTest.php`
- [x] T023 [P] [US4] Add invalid order status, user filter, sort, and pagination tests in `tests/Feature/Order/OrderListingTest.php`

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T024 [P] [US4] Add product collection validation in `app/Http/Requests/Product/IndexProductsRequest.php`
- [x] T025 [P] [US4] Add order collection validation and admin-only user filtering in `app/Http/Requests/Order/IndexOrdersRequest.php`
- [x] T026 [US4] Build product and order queries only from validated inputs in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProductController.php` and `app/Http/Controllers/Api/OrderController.php`
- [x] T027 [US4] Add accepted query values and representative validation errors to `README.md` and `docs/postman_collection.json`
- [x] T028 [US4] Run focused product/order listing tests in `tests/Feature/Product/ProductListingTest.php` and `tests/Feature/Order/OrderListingTest.php` and verify unchanged pagination response shapes

---

## Phase 7: Polish and Cross-Cutting Verification

- [x] T029 Validate `database/migrations/2026_07_22_010000_create_pending_file_deletions_table.php` add/down/reapply while preserving product, notification, subscription, and image state
- [x] T030 Run the complete SQLite suite from `phpunit.xml` and confirm only production concurrency scenarios skip
- [x] T031 Run the complete MySQL suite through `.github/workflows/tests.yml` settings and confirm both multi-process scenarios execute
- [x] T032 Run the complete PostgreSQL suite through `.github/workflows/tests.yml` settings and confirm both multi-process scenarios execute
- [x] T033 Run Pint, Composer strict validation/audit, PHP syntax, Postman JSON, workflow YAML, schedule, and `git diff --check`
- [x] T034 Review the final diff rooted at `.` for public-contract drift, filesystem rollback gaps, duplicate delivery windows, database portability, and unrelated user changes
- [x] T035 Update all task checkboxes and append exact verification results to `specs/002-api-resilience-completion/tasks.md`
- [x] T036 Extend the order worker with an explicit quantity and prove that two buyers each
  requesting two units from stock three produce one order, one rejection, and stock one on
  MySQL and PostgreSQL

## Dependencies and Execution Order

- T001–T002 establish the baseline and shared contracts.
- US1, US2, and US4 are source-file independent except for final README/controller integration.
- US3 depends on the US2 deduplicator and the existing order locks.
- Cross-cutting verification depends on every user story.

## Parallel Opportunities

- T003 and T004 affect separate test areas.
- T011 and T012 affect separate unit/feature tests.
- T022–T025 can be prepared in parallel by file ownership.
- MySQL and PostgreSQL verification environments may run independently.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Protect product media and notification delivery first because they close integrity gaps.
2. Build the real concurrency harness on the finished delivery/order primitives.
3. Add strict listing validation without changing successful collection behavior.
4. Verify every database family and operational failure path before commit/push.

## Baseline Record

- Branch: `feature/docs`.
- Prior commit: `afe855a feat: harden auth and order reliability`.
- Tests: 135 passed, 597 assertions on SQLite; the previous batch also passed on MySQL 8.
- User-owned untracked file: `STUDY_NOTES.md` (must remain excluded).
- Graphify output is local and ignored.

## Completion Verification (2026-07-22)

- Focused changed-behavior regression: 63 tests passed, 233 assertions.
- SQLite full suite: 166 tests; 163 passed, 3 production-engine concurrency tests skipped,
  806 assertions.
- MySQL 8 full suite: 166 tests passed, 833 assertions.
- PostgreSQL 16 full suite: 166 tests passed, 833 assertions.
- Independent-process concurrency gate: 3 tests passed and 27 assertions on each of MySQL
  8 and PostgreSQL 16 with skipped tests treated as failures. This includes the last-unit,
  competing multi-unit, and notification-deduplication races.
- Pending-file-deletion migration was rolled back and reapplied against a disposable SQLite
  database while product image paths, notification rows, and stock subscriptions remained.
- Pint, PHP syntax, strict Composer validation, locked dependency audit, Postman JSON,
  workflow YAML, scheduler discovery, and `git diff --check` passed.
- `STUDY_NOTES.md` remains untracked and excluded from the implementation.
