# Resilience Requirements Checklist

**Purpose**: Review failure, retry, concurrency, and validation requirement quality before implementation

**Created**: 2026-07-22

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are create, replace, delete, cleanup-failure, and cleanup-retry media scenarios all specified? [Completeness, Spec §US1]
- [x] CHK002 Are new, duplicate, concurrent, failed, and retried notification deliveries specified? [Completeness, Spec §US2]
- [x] CHK003 Are process overlap, database coverage, timeout, and unsupported-environment outcomes specified? [Completeness, Spec §US3]
- [x] CHK004 Are all accepted product and order listing fields covered by validation requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-012–FR-013]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK005 Is the difference between broken references, compensated files, and durable pending cleanup explicit? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001–FR-004]
- [x] CHK006 Is the durable notification boundary distinguished from best-effort external delivery? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005–FR-007]
- [x] CHK007 Is “independent process” defined strongly enough to exclude sequential or same-connection simulations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK008 Are invalid pagination and cross-field price range boundaries quantified? [Clarity, Spec §US4]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK009 Do media success semantics remain consistent with deferred cleanup requirements? [Consistency, Spec §US1/AC3 and FR-004]
- [x] CHK010 Do duplicate notification no-op semantics align with subscription consumption rules? [Consistency, Spec §US2/AC2–AC4]
- [x] CHK011 Do local skip rules remain consistent with the requirement that both production database jobs execute concurrency tests? [Consistency, Spec §FR-010–FR-011]
- [x] CHK012 Do strict listing validation requirements preserve existing valid authorization and response contracts? [Consistency, Spec §FR-014–FR-015]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK013 Can image consistency be measured as zero broken references and zero untracked unused files? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [x] CHK014 Is notification deduplication quantified across repeated delivery attempts? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [x] CHK015 Are the last-unit and competing multi-unit stock invariants objectively defined for every production locking environment? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]
- [x] CHK016 Are invalid listing results measurable through status and field-addressable errors? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]

## Recovery and Edge Cases

- [x] CHK017 Are non-throwing storage failures and already-missing files addressed? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK018 Is retry behavior defined for delivery failure before and after durable notification creation? [Recovery, Spec §FR-007–FR-008]
- [x] CHK019 Are harness startup, timeout, process exit, and malformed-output failures prohibited from false passing? [Coverage, Spec §RR-005]
- [x] CHK020 Are migration preservation and rollback boundaries defined for existing records and files? [Recovery, Spec §RR-006]
